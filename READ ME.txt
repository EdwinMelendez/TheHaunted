The Haunted Read Me:

This project has been adapted from an online tutorial base in C#

http://www.3dbuzz.com/training/view/xna-volume-1/hyperion-text-adventure-game

The goal of this project was to expand on the basic tutorial to create a full
fledged text rpg game engine. In itâ€™s current form I believe it sticks true to
the intended goal.
